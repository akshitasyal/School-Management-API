##  Setup Instructions

### 1️ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-api.git
cd school-management-api
```

---

### 2️ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3️ Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=school_db
```

---

### 4️ Setup MySQL Database

Run the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school_db;

USE school_db;

CREATE TABLE schools (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    latitude FLOAT NOT NULL,
    longitude FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```

---

###  Run the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server will run on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
